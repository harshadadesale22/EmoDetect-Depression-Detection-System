# 🧠 EmoDetect: Depression Detection System

An AI-powered **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** web application that detects signs of depression from user-entered text using **DistilBERT** and provides **SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations)** visualizations for transparent and explainable predictions.

---

# 📖 Overview

EmoDetect is an AI-powered depression detection system developed using **DistilBERT**, **Flask**, and **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**. The application analyzes textual input to classify it as **Depressed** or **Not Depressed**, along with a confidence score and SHAP-based explainability graph that highlights the words influencing the prediction.

# ⚙️ Installation

## Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/harshadadesale22/EmoDetect-Depression-Detection-System.git
```

### Backend Setup

```bash
cd Backend

pip install -r requirements.txt

python app.py
```

### Frontend Setup

Open the `Frontend` folder and launch the application using a local web server (for example, VS Code Live Server) or your preferred static file server.

---

# 🚀 Workflow

1. User enters text into the web interface.
2. The frontend sends the input to the Flask backend.
3. DistilBERT processes the text.
4. The model predicts whether the text indicates **Depressed** or **Not Depressed**.
5. SHAP generates an explainability graph showing the most influential words.
6. The prediction, confidence score, detected emotion, and SHAP visualization are displayed.

---

# 📊 Output

The application provides:

* Depression Prediction
* Detected Emotion
* Confidence Score
* SHAP Explainability Graph
* Important Influential Words

---

# 🔮 Future Enhancements
